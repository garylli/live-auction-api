# Live Auction API
Since most of my contributions are made to private repositories, many recruiters and hiring mnanagers have expressed a desire for
a public repository where they can see some code.

Recently, I've been interested in stream processing and building durable, performant systems, mostly stemming from an [awesome paper](https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying) I read by LinkedIn. 

I felt like this project would be the perfect showcase of what I've learned since graduating 2 years ago and serve as a playground for me to explore live data streaming, database migrations, and Kafka.

## Goals and Objectives
The main goals I have for this project are
1. Get a stronger grasp on database administration and the SQL language
2. Write a robust test suite that hardens the correct surface while leaving the rest malleable
3. Benchmark at scale
4. Experiment with Kafka and Websockets
5. Create CI/CD pipelines to speed up real-world deployments.

Since I've mainly been working in startups for the past 2 years, I haven't had as much time as I'd like to explore robust, long-term programming as I'd have liked. This is why I want to intentionally set aside time to go deep into the weeds.

For example, writing SQL queries from scratch again, spinning up and diving into the weeds of postgres databases, and WRITING TESTS (a severely underdeveloped skill in the early-stage startup world).

Most of all, I'm hoping to have fun while delivering a concrete showcase of my learnings.
